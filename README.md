## Ideas
- Solar eclipse passed over Houston on 21 August 2017 at approximately 1:14 PM CDT (18:14 UTC)
- AR NOAA 12671 is nearly dead-on disk center at this time (go to Helioviewer to get more precise dates/times)
- Use HMI data to construct field extrapolation
- Simulate emission in all channels of AIA
- Blend a few different ones
- Show side-by-side comparison with observations
- Incorporate eclipse observations somehow? Not clear exactly on how this would work
